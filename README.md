UThere
======

UThere is a fork of [Wazapp](https://github.com/tgalal/wazapp). The aim of this project is to port OpenWhatsapp for the N9 to Ubuntu Touch so that also people on Ubuntu Touch are able to chat with their Whatsapp buddies.

Wazapp (the current code) consists of 2 parts, the IM application (wazapp), which is in Python, 
and the accounts plugin (waxmppplugin) in C++. The UI seems to be written in QML.

Seeing that Python and C++ are supported languages on Ubuntu Touch, porting the UI to Ubuntu Touch is the first priority. 

If you want to help out, fork this repo, or open an issue to discuss some stuff. This is just a starting point, let's see what we can make happen.

**UThere is powered by [Yowsup](https://github.com/tgalal/yowsup), the python Whatsapp Library**
